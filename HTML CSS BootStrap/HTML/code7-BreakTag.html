        Please compile, please compile,
        It would surely make me smile,
        When I glance at the clock,
        And thirty minutes has gone by non-stop,
        I think that I've won, that I've beaten the odds,
        But alas it is not the day, says the evil programming gods,
        As this is all a ruse, just one big long deception,
        Since my terminal froze ten minutes ago, from an UndefinedException
      </p>
